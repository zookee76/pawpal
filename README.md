## Description
**PawPal** is an all-in-one mobile application designed for pet clinic veterinarians and staff to efficiently manage pet health care. With PawPal, clinic staff and veterinarians can keep track of pets' medical records, medication schedules, vet appointments, and dietary plans.

Pet owners have view-only access to their pet's medical diagnoses, lab results, and records, with the ability to share records with other veterinarians or co-parent owners by scanning a QR code.
